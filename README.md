The first thing you want to do is a npm install. 
```bash
npm i
```
Next you want to log into SQL and run your schema to create the database if it doesn't already exist.
```bash
source db/schema.sql
```
Next run you have to seed the database.
```bash
npm run seed 
```
Next you need to start the server.
```bash
npm start 
```

Once your server is up and running you will need an application like Postman or Insomnia to test your routes.
